# 🚀 AI SDLC Agent – Automating Software Development!

### Note: Please Read the Complete Readme.md File!

## 🛑 Sorry for the Delay! 😅

Hey everyone! First of all, **sorry for the delay** in pushing this project! I ran into **a lot of errors** while trying to install `Crew.ai` on my local machine. I know I could have used **Google Colab**, but honestly, writing code in Colab doesn’t feel as enjoyable as coding in **VS Code**! 😎

So, I decided to **fix everything locally** instead! 💪

### 🛠️ Installation Struggles 😵‍💫

To get `Crew.ai` running, I had to:  
1️⃣ First install **Microsoft Build Tools** (needed for the C compiler since Crew.ai supports C development).  
2️⃣ Try out **multiple solutions**, debugging every issue along the way.  
3️⃣ Finally, after a lot of trial and error, I got it running successfully! 🎉
